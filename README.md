Get in The Zone is a web application designed to help civilians in war torn countries. Governments, trusted organisations and individuals log approximate 'safe-zones' with information about capacity, suitability for different individuals and shelter/aid available. Alerts are then sent to users of the web application who opt in whenever a safe-zone / humanitarian zone is declared and in proximity.
